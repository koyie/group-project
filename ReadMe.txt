Our web app is composed of four html pages, one css page, and five java script files. 
The home page is connected to the about, contact, and creators page via <a> tags. 
Our web app allows the user to encrypt, decrypt, compress, and decompress. 
All of these functions are accessed through buttons and pop ups on the home page.
The user is then prompted to upload a file and choose the encryption/ compression method that they prefer.
At the moment the only function that is functioning properly is the encryption. which takes the file and output it encrypted into a textbax.
This will more than likely change to where the user uploads a file and is presented with an encryped file to download when finished.
The decompression is just the same as the encryption however at the moment we cannot figure out why it is not functioning like the encryption is.
The compression and decompression code can be found in the inflate.js file. 
That code works on Deeps computer we are just working on intergrating that into the project with all of the other codes.
So most of these files and things will change by next week as we get everything functioning properly and all linked together.
Everything will hopefully be input file and recieve a "transformed" file to download.
