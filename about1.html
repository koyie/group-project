    <p>
       User will be able to upload a file and receive an encrypted form of the same file
        Our encryption algorithms will include AES, MD5, and DES.
        These encryptions are some of the strongest encryptions there are. 
        AES, Advanced Encryption Standard, is a symmetric block cipher. 
        It is used throughout the world to encrypt sensitive data. 
        MD5, Message Digest 5, is a hash function that converts strings or text into 128-bits hash. 
        DES also know as Data Encryption Standard. 
        It is a symmetric-key algorithm, that encrypts groups of 64 bits.
        Each encryption has their own corresponding decryption algorithm.
        <br><br>
        In addition to encryption, the web application also provides compression/decompression with LZ77 and DEFLATE. 
        LZ77 is a lossless data compresssion algorithm. 
        It works by groupoing symbols into strings, and then converting the strings into code.
        DEFLATE is another lossess data compression algorithm.
        This compression works by finding sequences of data that repeat and encode each sequence with a pair of numbers.
        Just like the encryption, with each compression, there is a also a decompresss for LZ77 and DEFLATE.
        This will allow users to safely send files over the internet.
